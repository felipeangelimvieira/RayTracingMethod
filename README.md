# RayTracingMethod
Algorithm to calculate modal shapes and natural frequencies of 3D beam structures based on a wave approach (in  MatLab).
This project was part of a research in Ecole Centrale de Lyon

## Examples
In blue, the deformation estimated with Finite Elements. In black, the calculated deformation using the Ray Tracing Methods.
